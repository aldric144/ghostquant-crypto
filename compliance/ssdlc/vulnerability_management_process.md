## 3. SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

### 3.1 SAST Overview

**SAST** analyzes source code for security vulnerabilities without executing the code.

**Tools**:
- **Python**: Bandit, Semgrep
- **TypeScript**: ESLint Security Plugin, Semgrep
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Checkov, tfsec

**Frequency**: Every pull request (automated via CI/CD)

### 3.2 SAST Configuration

**Bandit (Python)**:

```yaml
# .bandit
[bandit]
exclude: /test,/venv,/node_modules
tests: B201,B301,B302,B303,B304,B305,B306,B307,B308,B309,B310,B311,B312,B313,B314,B315,B316,B317,B318,B319,B320,B321,B322,B323,B324,B325,B401,B402,B403,B404,B405,B406,B407,B408,B409,B410,B411,B412,B413,B501,B502,B503,B504,B505,B506,B507,B601,B602,B603,B604,B605,B606,B607,B608,B609,B610,B611,B701,B702,B703

# Run Bandit
bandit -r . -f json -o bandit-report.json
```

**ESLint Security Plugin (TypeScript)**:

```json
// .eslintrc.json
{
  "extends": [
    "plugin:security/recommended"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "security"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "security/detect-object-injection": "error",
    "security/detect-non-literal-regexp": "error",
    "security/detect-unsafe-regex": "error",
    "security/detect-buffer-noassert": "error",
    "security/detect-child-process": "error",
    "security/detect-disable-mustache-escape": "error",
    "security/detect-eval-with-expression": "error",
    "security/detect-no-csrf-before-method-override": "error",
    "security/detect-non-literal-fs-filename": "error",
    "security/detect-non-literal-require": "error",
    "security/detect-possible-timing-attacks": "error",
    "security/detect-pseudoRandomBytes": "error"
  }
}
```

### 3.3 SAST Checks

**SAST scans for**:

### 3.4 SAST Enforcement

**SAST is enforced via CI/CD pipeline**:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
name: SAST

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  bandit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Bandit
        run: |
          pip install bandit
          bandit -r . -f json -o bandit-report.json
      - name: Check for vulnerabilities
        run: |
          if grep -q '"issue_severity": "HIGH"' bandit-report.json; then
            echo "High severity vulnerabilities found"
            exit 1
          fi
          if grep -q '"issue_severity": "MEDIUM"' bandit-report.json; then
            echo "Medium severity vulnerabilities found"
            exit 1
          fi
```

**Enforcement Rules**:
- ✅ Pull requests with critical/high SAST findings CANNOT be merged
- ✅ Pull requests with medium SAST findings require CISO approval
- ✅ Pull requests with low SAST findings can be merged (but must be remediated within 30 days)

            -t https://staging.ghostquant.com \
            -J zap-report.json
      - name: Check for vulnerabilities
        run: |
          if grep -q '"risk": "High"' zap-report.json; then
            echo "High risk vulnerabilities found"
            exit 1
          fi
```

**Enforcement Rules**:

6. **Verification**: QA Team retests vulnerability (verify fix)
7. **Regression Testing**: QA Team runs regression tests (verify no new issues)
8. **Documentation**: Fix documented in Genesis Archive™
9. **Deployment**: Fix deployed to production

### 8.3 Remediation Tracking

**Vulnerabilities are tracked in**:

- **Jira**: Vulnerability tickets (assigned to development team)
- **GitHub**: Security advisories (for open-source dependencies)
- **Genesis Archive™**: Audit trail (all vulnerability events logged)

**Tracking Metrics**:
- ✅ Time to detect (TTD): Time from vulnerability disclosure to detection
- ✅ Time to triage (TTT): Time from detection to triage
- ✅ Time to remediate (TTR): Time from triage to remediation
